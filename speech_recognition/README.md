# ADMM Pruning Models with the PyTorch-Kaldi Speech Recognition Toolkit
PyTorch-Kaldi is an open-source repository for developing state-of-the-art DNN/HMM speech recognition systems. The DNN part is managed by PyTorch, while feature extraction, label computation, and decoding are performed with the Kaldi toolkit.

You can see the results with the prunned models in GRU_models file. You can also enter PyTorch-Kaldi Speech Recognition Toolkit(https://github.com/mravanelli/pytorch-kaldi) to deploy the models for ASR.
